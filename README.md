# Sorting Algorithms in Python:

Sorting a list in data structures and algorithm without using built-in functions is hectic for some as it was for me earlier. To help, here's what I was able to code.

The repository includes 4 different types of sorting algorithms they be:
 
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort (Ascending and descending order)

 Finally, there is a utilization of this sorting, which firsts sorts a list and then searches the element you want from the list and brings you it's index.
 
 P.S: Its supposed to be a help for beginners, not a copy paste utility, if it even reaches them :D
